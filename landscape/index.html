                  <p><b>Lincoln is a very small and quite city, and I don't have 
                    much chance to photograph landscapes. But we has a couple 
                    of very beautiful lakes in the city, and it is my first subject 
                    to learn landscape photography. May is the start of the summer, 
                    and I only have about two minutes to catch the sunset when 
                    it is touching down the horizon. So within 3 days I calculate 
                    the exact time when the sun touch down, and go back the second 
                    day to shot again. This is also my first try to use slide 
                    film. I shot the sunset with a whole 36-frame roll of Fujichrome 
                    Sensia II 100, in two days. Most of them were under-exposured, 
                    since I metered at the sun, not the sky. This would be a good 
                    subject to learn light metering technique.</b></p>

                  that they can get the prints as soon as possible. All I have 
                  done was grabbed my gears and finished that roll with night 
                  photos. Esther L. Kauffman Academic Residential Center is opened 
                  in the spring of 2001. I was shotting the Nebraska Union from 
                  the door of the Kauffman Center. Nebraska Union is the student
