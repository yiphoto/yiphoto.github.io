<h3 class="title">Write better notes to you customers</h3>

<p>Don't send the business notes to your customers on Christmas because it is not personal, and every sales person are sending it. Try some creative ways to keep your name in front of your clients.</p>

<p><b>1. Don't send cards on the same holidays everyone else does.</b><br />
For example, everyone sends Christmas cards and birthday cards. Send cards to your clients on less traditional holidays, like the Fourth of July instead of Christmas. This is easy to make you stand out of the crowd.</p>

<p><b>2. Send a note even when you don't get the sale.</b><br />
It seems the author didn't show the real result you can get from this, but the author shows that the message you can convey is that you are still in the market and will be for many years to come.</p>

<p><b>3. Send a note when you've been quoted in the news media.</b><br />
This is new to me, but I remember there is an aritcle from Inc.com regarding a business owner sending out emails to her clients about her press release and was blamed for spaming. The author says he would like to send out thousands of copies of his press clips, with a little note that says, "Thought you might be interested in this issue." This will help you to stand out from the pack if your competitors only send out simple thank-you notes.</p>

<p><b>4. Send a note after you've met someone new.</b>I met many people new yesterday afternoon at the "business after hours" meeting held by Lincoln Chamber of Commerce. I did send out 3 cards, but I am concerned about the cost. It seems I need to find a more cost-effective way about the notes. The author stress that, a salesperson succeeds in direct proportion to the number of people who know him.  </p>

<p><b>5. Send mail as a way to generate different kinds of income streams.</b></p>

<p><b>6. Send out lots of different kinds of mailings.</b> This is pretty new to me. The mailings could include thank-you notes, birthday cards, press clippings, holiday greetings, follow-ups on previous contacts, and a whole lot more. <i>It seems these mailings are all very common to me</i></p>

<p><b><u>Summary</u></b><br />
Send notes to every customer, and everyone you've met new. Send many different kind of notes.<br />
