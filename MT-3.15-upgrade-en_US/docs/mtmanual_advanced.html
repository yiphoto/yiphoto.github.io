<h2><a name="scheduled posting"></a>Scheduled Posting</h2>
<p>To set up scheduled posting in this version, you need to be able to
set up a ``cron'' job on the server. There are at least two ways to do
this: using shell access, or through cPanel. Some hosting providers
will allow one and not the other.</p>
<p>Once you've set up post scheduling, when you save an entry with a post
status of ``Future'', it will be automatically picked up and published by
the script when it runs.</p>
<p>Note that you need to use the field labeled ``Authored On'' on the Edit
Entry screen to specify the time when the entry should go live.</p>
<p><strong>If you have shell access to your server:</strong></p>
<p>If you have shell access, you can set up scheduled posting as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_Log_in_to_the_server"></a>Log in to the server</strong><br>

<li><strong><a name="item_Edit_your_crontab%3A"></a>Edit your crontab:</strong><br>

<pre>% crontab -e
</pre><li><strong><a name="item_Add_the_following_line%3A"></a>Add the following line:</strong><br>

<pre>0,15,30,45 * * * * cd &lt;path to mt&gt;; ./tools/run-periodic-tasks
</pre></ol>
<p>This instructs the cron monkey to run the script at zero, fifteen,
thirty, and forty-five minutes after the hour, every hour. The
asterisks are a way of telling cron to do this every hour, every day,
every day of the week and month. Make sure you have exactly four
asterisks separated by spaces.</p>
<p><code>&lt;path to mt&gt;</code> should be the path to your Movable Type
application directory.</p>
<p>After that, just save the file, exiting your editor, and cron will
report that it installed a new crontab.</p>
<p><strong>If you have cPanel:</strong></p>
<p>To set up scheduled posting through cPanel, follow the directions below:</p>
<p><img src="cpanel_cron_std.png"></p><p>In the box labeled ``Command to run,'' enter the path to your Movable Type
installation, followed by <code>/tools/run-periodic-tasks</code>:</p>
<pre> cd &lt;path to mt&gt;; ./tools/run-periodic-tasks
</pre><p>The timing options can be set to a schedule that suits you, however,
it is not wise to run the script more often than about once every
fifteen minutes, since it could bog down your server. We recommend
the settings ``Every fifteen minutes,'' ``Every Hour,'' ``Every Day,'' ``Every
Month,'' and ``Every Weekday.''</p>
